## 1. Progress update according to Gantt chart with over/under of progress vs. plan
We are still in the initial research phase. There have been roadblocks with researching the embedded controllers to use, and designing the antenna. 
We are making progress, however, it seems to be going slower than intended. 

## 2. Update of teamwork: who is doing which tasks
### Task 1:


Team<br>Member | Task      | Status
---------------|-----------|-------
  Trey         | Order uCs |  IP

### Task 2:


Team<br>Member | Task                                      | Status
---------------|-------------------------------------------|-------
  Trey         | Research compatible uCs for embedded demo |  DN

### Task 3:


Team<br>Member | Task                                             | Status
---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------
  All          | Finish proposal and settle on final deliverables | DN

### Task 4:

## 3. Describe any new bottleneck/hurdle discovered and a plan to address it
The team is struggling as a whole to make substantive progress on the project. Any efforts towards our immediate goals have been sporatic and disorganized. There are a few contributing factors to this dynamic. First, the team has agreed to meet up each tuesday to discuss progress, but 

We are also limited by available hardware to begin prototyping. The esp32 we have does not support ethernet without an external controller, and we do not have an alternative yet.

## 4. If behind schedule, provide a plan to address it
We plan to carve out additional meeting times for the team, and to make plans going in to the meeting what we plan to work on. Additionally, we plan to discuss next steps at the end of each meeting so everyone is aware what the others in the team are working on. 


## 5. Describe the steps for the next two weeks (what each person will be working on each week)
### Week of 2/11/25:
Over the next two weeks, we plan to purchase components for the embedded deliverable and start prototyping code for the embedded control group. This code will be just a simple WIFI protocol implementation so we can compare the bandwidth requirements to our compression network. 
Additionally, we plan to continue research and development on the AutoEncoder and core framework of our program to make steady progress toward completion.

### Week of 2/18/25:
Trey will be in charge of placing an order for embedded controllers, and start planning and researching potential roadblocks for the control group code.
